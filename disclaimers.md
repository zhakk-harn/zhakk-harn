My lifespan would be infinite I would help you 100%, but it isn’t. I’m not a asshole when I’m unprovoked so I’m not saying I'll always refuse to help. Feel free to ask, but do not expect proper “customer service” without being  a customer, I hope it makes sense.

# The package is namespaced as an invitation

If you found a package under my nampespace it's because I expect to get forked at some point by people more commited to solving the problem.
