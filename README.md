### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I help student designers with acquiinge and using all sorts of technical knowledge.

Right now I'm on the lookout for simple and libre tech to help teaching. I'm even building some, like [Fido, our very simple template fetcher (it's a minimalist GUI for github)](https://github.com/AtelierNum/fido). If you have ideas in this domain I'd be very interested to read about them at valentin(a)dupas.me
