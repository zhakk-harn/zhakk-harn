### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I help student designer to acquire and use all sorts of technical knowledge.

Right now I'm on the lookout for simple and libre tech to help teaching. I'm even building some, like [Fido, our (very simple) template fetcher with a GUI](https://github.com/AtelierNum/fido). If you have ideas in this domain I'd be very interested to read about them at valentin.lc.dupas@gmail.com

These days what is getting me excited is :
- [Caramel, Ocaml -> Erlang for building type-safe, scalable, and maintainable applications](https://caramel.run/)
- [Tauri, build native aps using web technologies for the UI on top of Rust](https://tauri.studio/en/)
- Webcomponents
- Graph databases
