### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I help student designers to acquire and use all sorts of technical knowledge.

Right now I'm on the lookout for simple and libre tech to help teaching. I'm even building some, like [Fido, our (very simple) template fetcher with a GUI](https://github.com/AtelierNum/fido). If you have ideas in this domain I'd be very interested to read about them at valentin@dupas.me
